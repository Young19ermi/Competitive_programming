Method 2: Modify Settings

Open the VS Code settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS).
Search for "recommendations" or "codeLens".
You might find settings like:
extensions.recommendationsAriaLabel: Controls the label displayed in the recommendation notification. Set it to false to hide the label.
editor.codeLens: Controls whether to show CodeLens information (which can include recommendations). Set it to false to disable all CodeLens features, including recommendations.
Adjust the settings based on your preference.
