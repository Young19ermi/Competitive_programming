		 Once the element is shifted, it is referred to as 'i',
		  and 'i+1' represents the next element. On the other side,
		  'j' is used to represent the previous element and 'j+1'
		   represents the current element. So, when 'j' is shifted to 'i',
		    it is essentially cancelled out, and the variable
		     'j+1' becomes necessary to refer to the relevant element.
		This is why we use 'j+1' instead of just 'j'."""
